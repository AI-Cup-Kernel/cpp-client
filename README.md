### How to Set Up

We have prepared a makefile to simplify the building process. If you are using an editor or an IDE, please use the provided makefile for building.

First, you should install `make`. If you are using macOS or Linux, there is a good chance you already have `make` installed.

#### Linux
sudo apt-get install make

vbnet
Copy code

#### macOS
If you don't have Homebrew, you can install it using the following command:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
You can also install it like in Windows, but look for the macOS version on this link. Just download the binaries, not the source.

bash
Copy code
brew install make
Windows
Download this and install it.

Now, extract the downloaded file anywhere and add the bin folder to your system's PATH. Alternatively, you can use the complete path when running the make command.

Installing libcurl
Linux
arduino
Copy code
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
Make sure to run sudo apt-get update first.

macOS
Copy code
brew install curl-openssl
If these commands don't work, you can follow the instructions for Windows.

Windows
Go to this link and download the appropriate libcurl version for Windows (64-bit). Extract the downloaded file to any location.

Optional: You can add the include and lib directories to your PATH. If you are using a code editor like Visual Studio Code and it doesn't recognize <curl/curl.h>, hover over the error, click on Quick Fix, and add the include path in the Include Path settings.

In the makefile, update the path: to your libcurl directory (if you installed it manually on Windows). For example, it could be path:=C:/libcurl.

Now, run the make command in the root folder (if it's not recognized, run it using the full path). This will build the executable file named game.
